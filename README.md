#### About Fire Engine:
Project currently under development as part of the training of the subject "Engine Development" taken at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia" through the attached center CITM, for the degree of Design and Development of Videogames.


This engine is being developed in C++ language using the OpenGl library.

The objective of this project is to train and gain experience in memory management and code optimization.

The creation of this engine will be to provide in a direct way, a tool for the development of Project 3, which aims to develop a video game with its own engine.
